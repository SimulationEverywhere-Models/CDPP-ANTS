Steps on testing the model:

For situation 1 (the cell faced only by one ant)
run Runwalk1.bat
(walk1.ma and walk1.val and output1.drw for plane 0)
run Runwalk11.bat generates output1.drw for two planes (Plane 0 and Plane1)

For situation 2(the cell faced by two ants)
run Runwalk2.bat 
(walk2.ma and walk2.val and output2.drw for plane 0)
run Runwalk21.bat generates output2.drw for two planes (Plane 0 and Plane1)

For situation 3 and 4(the cell faced by three or four ants)
run Runwalk34.bat 
(walk34.ma and walk34.val and output34.drw for plane 0)
run Runwalk21.bat generates output34.drw for two planes (Plane 0 and Plane1)

For situation 5 (the cell faced  by four ants at different directions)
run Runwalk5.bat 
(walk5.ma and walk5.val and output5.drw for plane 0)
run Runwalk51.bat generates output5.drw for two planes (Plane 0 and Plane1)

For situation 6 (Randomly choose the celled occupied by ants facing random directions)
run Runwalk.bat to generate output.drw for plane 0,which can be used for applet simulation.
at the same time,it also generate outputp2.drw for plane0 and plane1.
(walk.ma and walk.val and output.drw for plane 0 and outputp2.drw for plane 0 and plane 1)

Note: please run RunwalkX.bat rather than RunwalkXX.bat to generate outputX.drw files for online 
simulation.
